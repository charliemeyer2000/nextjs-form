# My First NextJS application

Hi. This is my first nextjs application. Not my usual thing, but ceretianly a cool platform. Vercel is sweet! [Here's](https://nextjs-form-rbyq-3mvfqdl4j-charliemeyer2000.vercel.app/) the link to the deployment. It is a simple form. I wrote this in like 3 hours after finishing my 9-5 job while simultaneously learning nextjs, so take it with a grain of salt pls

## Features

- Jest testing
- Redux
- it looks pretty, i think?

## Things Learned

- nextjs cool. They have tons of great features and integrate well, and their CI/Cd pipeline is SO easy especialyl in comparison to my custom scripts to build and deploy docker images using GCR. 
- Great documentation and tutorials, also bonus points for MDX. 
- CSS modules are a big w. Having written like 20k lines of css in my life using naming conventions to avoid overlapping css classnames, modules are a big w
- tailwind? I might try tailwind, just to see what it's all about.
- no more ugly imports. The '@/pages/form/Intro' and stuff like that made imports much easier. Gone are the days of '../../../../../assets/image.png.'
- beware of vendor lock-in. Nextjs cool, but i'm worried that they lock you in super quickly and once you start using their service and build larger-scale applications and stuff you will be charged abhorrent amounts of money.
- lack of configuration: nextjs cool because they make deployment and building and all that stuff super easy, but at the same time taht strips a lot of configuration that you might want to do. Pluses and deltas. 
- edge functions seem kinda sick ig

## For the future
- I think i might use next for the future for a blog or something, or maybe for personal website. Pretty cool and simple. However, since i use personal website for my email, idk if that's possible.
- I think next is great for static sites and stuff with minimal api calls or communication with a backend/other services.
